# GitHub Repository Readme

Welcome to the Engineering Systems Design 1 project repository for the ENGR10004 Engineering: Technology and Society Semester 1, 2021 course. This repository contains the documentation and resources for our project, which focuses on designing a solution for the distribution, pumping, disinfection, and monitoring of water to a remote community using renewable energy resources.

# Project Description

Our project involves working as an engineering team to plan, design, construct, test, and report on a real-world design problem. The goal is to improve the water delivery process for a remote community by designing and implementing a pumping station that disinfects and supplies drinking water from an underground well. The project includes sub-systems such as the impeller and pump design, water treatment disinfection process using a membrane unit, inline image monitoring for particle contamination detection, and the water pipe distribution network.

# Project Modules

# Impeller and Pump Design
In this module, we will explore various pump configurations and designs, with a focus on the impeller and its efficiency in converting rotational energy into increased water pressure. We will conduct performance measurements, experiment with impeller designs, and develop a custom pump impeller using 3D printing.

# Water Treatment Disinfection System
The water treatment module revolves around disinfecting water using ozone to eliminate biological contaminants. We will investigate ozone generation, transfer methods, and the use of a membrane unit as a gas-liquid contactor. While we won't work with ozone in the experimental rig, we will develop an image processing algorithm to monitor particle contamination using a high-speed camera.

# Inline Image Monitoring
The inline image monitoring system is crucial for detecting particle contamination in the water. We will develop a real-time image processing system using a camera and image analysis to detect particles. If the contamination exceeds a critical level, a control valve will be triggered to recycle water and change the particle filter.

# Water Pipe Distribution Network
The water pipe distribution network consists of two sections: transferring water from the storage tank to the town and delivering water within the community. We will investigate pressure and friction losses, measure the frictional losses in a flow circuit, and design the network based on pipe diameters, elevations, bends, T-junctions, and valves.
